			<!-- <h3>Cocaine Use - Highest Among Young Adults 18-25</h3>
			<hr> -->

			<h3>Why Peaks Recovery Centers after inpatient rehab?</h3>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year after treatment.</a></p>
			<p>At Peaks Recovery Centers we recognize that the process for shutting off cocaine cravings, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing cocaine, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from cocaine addiction.</p>
			<p>The longer young adults participate in treatment programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe it paramount to the long-term success of young adults and their recovery that they continue with extended care treatment. Our six-month program allows each individual to incrementally move forward in their recovery rather than being exposed to an array of immeidiate challenges that often times can be defeating in early recovery. Our programs are favorably structured for young adults and specifically designed to promote long-term recovery in an accountable, communal setting.</p>

			<h3>Cocaine usage and young adults 18-25</h3>
			<p>In 2014 there was an estimated 1.5 million current cocaine users aged 12 and older within the United States. Adults aged 18-25 have a higher rate of current cocaine use than any other group. According to the NSDUH, about 913,000 Americans met the DSM-5 criteria for dependence or abuse of cocaine during the past 12 months. Nearly 40% of all drug misuse or abuse related emergency department visits involved cocaine recorded in a 2011 study. Another study out of Spain shows that, when compared to the general population, those that had recently used cocaine had sudden death rates between 13-58% times higher.</p>

			<h3>Effects of Cocaine</h3>
			<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dbc2wlvk8/image/upload/c_fill,fl_any_format.lossy,w_300/v1480720177/peaks/peaks-centers/Cocaine-Molecule.jpg" align="left" alt="Cocaine Addiction Molecule"> Like both heroin and meth, the experiential effect that follows cocaine use is due to an increase in dopamine levels within the brain. The immediate effects of cocaine depend on the method of use e.g. snorted, inhaled, or injected. The faster the drug is absorbed, the more intense the resulting high. However, the duration of the resulting high is reduced by how quickly it is absorbed. Snorting cocaine, for example, results in a 15-30 minute high whereas smoking cocaine results in a 10-15 minute high. This catch-22 effect results in greater usage and higher costs associated with getting high.</p>
			<p>Cocaine usage is associated with both desired and undesired effects. The desired effects include feeling euphoric, energetic, mentally alert, and hypersensitive  to sight, sound, and touch. Shot-term side effects may include reduced need for food and sleep; constricted blood vessels; dilated pupils; and increased body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Feelings of irritability, relentlessness, anxiety, panic, and paranoia may also follow. Severe medical complications are also associated with cocaine use. Most of these medical complications are associated with the cardiovascular system, including disturbances in heart rhythm and heart attacks; neurological effects, including headaches, seizures, strokes, and coma. Sudden death may also occur in some instances and drug overdose kills nearly 6000 people every year.</p>
