	<h2>Admission Process</h2>
	<p>The process for shutting off our cravings for drugs and alcohol, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing drugs and alcohol, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Serenity Peaks Recovery Center we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from our unhealthy past.</p>

		<h3>Serenity Peaks Recovery's Model Of Care</h3>
		<p>At Serenity Peaks Recovery Center, our model of care specifically addresses the challenges young adults face in early recovery. Alcohol and drug addiction manifests itself differently for not only men and women, but addiction also manifests itself differently for individuals of different age groups. By primarily focusing on young adults we are able to build a culture of recovery unlike any other addiction treatment program in the state of Colorado.</p>
		<p>Have you, your daughter, or a friend struggled with finishing high school or getting a GED, holding down a job, becoming financially independent, or generally experienced issues with forming valuable relationships as a result of using and abusing drugs and alcohol or as a result of some underlying mental health disorder? If so, Serenity Peaks Recovery Center can help put many of these missing pieces back into place over the duration of our program.</p>
