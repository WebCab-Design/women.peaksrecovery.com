			<h3>What is Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/disorders/substance-use">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</a>, defines substance use disorder, also known as drug use disorder, occur when the recurrent use of alcohol, drugs, or both cause clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. The DSM-5 is the manual used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders. Each specific substance within the DSM-5 is addressed as a separate use disorder (e.g., alcohol use disorder, heroin use disorder, stimulant use disorder, etc.), but nearly all substances are diagnosed based on the same overarching criteria.</p>
			<p>Prior to the DSM-5,<a href="http://www.dsm5.org/documents/substance%20use%20disorder%20fact%20sheet.pdf"> the DSM-IV categorized substance abuse</a> and substance dependence into a single disorder measured on a continuum from mild to severe. In this overarching disorder, the criteria have not only been combined, but strengthened. For example, a diagnosis of a substance abuse previously required only one symptom. Now, mild substance use disorder in DSM-5 requires two to three symptoms from a list of 11. Additionally, the diagnosis of dependence caused much confusion. Most people link dependence with “addiction” when in fact dependence can be a normal body response to a substance.</p>

			<h3>Why Peaks Recovery Centers after inpatient rehab?</h3>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank"> 77% of individuals will relapse within their first year of treatment.</a></p>
			<p>At Peaks Recovery Centers we recognize that the process for shutting off drug and alcohol cravings, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing drugs and alcohol, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from our unhealthy past.</p>
			<p>The longer young adults participate in treatment programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe it paramount to the long-term success of young adults and their recovery that they continue with extended care treatment. Our six-month program allows each individual to incrementally move forward in their recovery rather than being exposed to an array of immeidiate challenges that often times can be defeating in early recovery. Our programs are favorably structured for young adults and specifically designed to promote long-term recovery in an accountable, communal setting.</p>
