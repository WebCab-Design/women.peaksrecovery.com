			<!-- <h3>13.1 Million Young Adults Binge Drink between ages 18-25</h3>
			<hr> -->

			<h3>Why Peaks Recovery Centers after inpatient rehab?</h3>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year after leaving treatment.</a></p>
			<p>At Peaks Recovery Centers we understand that the  process for shutting off alcohol cravings, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing alcohol, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from alcohol addiction.</p>
			<p>The longer young adults participate in alcohol treatment programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will achieve long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety from alcohol reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe it paramount to the long-term success of young adults and their recovery that they continue with extended care treatment. Our six-month program allows each individual to incrementally move forward in their recovery rather than being exposed to an array of immeidiate challenges that often times can be defeating in early recovery. Our programs are favorably structured for young adults and specifically designed to promote long-term recovery in an accountable, communal setting.</p>

			<h3>Alcohol Use and Young Adults 18-25</h3>
			<p>Between the ages of 18-25 there are 20.78 million current alcohol users. 13.1 million of these users are binge drinkers and 3.74 million are heavy drinkers.</p>
			<p>In 2014, 16.3 million adults aged 18 or older met criteria for Alcohol Disorder in the United States. Only about 1.5 million of them actually received treatment.</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812231" target="_blank">highest percentage of fatal crashes</a> are between the ages of 21-24, accounting for 30% of the 9,967 deaths among traffic fatalities.</p>

			<h3>Alcohol Statistics and Effects</h3>
			<p>Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused substance in the United States. Not many people are unaware of the short and long-term consequences of drinking. Several studies have pointed to the fact that alcohol in moderation can in fact be positive for your health. Moderate alcohol drinking is considered to be no more than two, 12 ounce beers or two, 4 ounce glasses of wine, or two, 1.5 ounce shot of a distilled spirit.</p>
			<p>There are nearly 140 million current drinkers in the United States who enjoy the short term effects of relaxation and reduced inhibition. Although these effects may be pleasant, alcohol is a depressant and with a enough use can lower concentration, reflex and response time leading to poor coordination, all of which result in the slowing down of the brain. Any short term-effect of alcohol can also be amplified when taken in conjunction with other drugs like cocaine.</p>
			<p>Alcohol becomes most problematic when the body and mind are subjected to long-periods of usage and binge drinking. Effects that follow in conjunction with misuse include:</p>

			<br>
			<p>Effects on the Heart:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cardiomyopathy – Stretching and drooping of heart muscle</li>
				<li>Arrhythmias – Irregular heart beat</li>
				<li>Stroke</li>
				<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<p>Effects on the Liver:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Steatosis, or fatty liver</li>
				<li>Alcoholic Hepatitis</li>
				<li>Fibrosis</li>
				<li>Cirrhosis</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<p>Pancrease: Alcohol causes the pancreas to produce toxic substances that can eventually lead to pancreatitis, a dangerous inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels in the pancreas that prevents proper digestion.</p>
			<p>Long-term alcohol consumption has been known to increase the likelihood of developing cancer in the following:</p>

			<br>
			<p>Effects on the Body:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mouth</li>
				<li>Esophagus</li>
				<li>Throat</li>
				<li>Liver</li>
				<li>Breast</li>
			</ul>

			<p><a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics" target="_blank">In 2010, alcohol misuse cost the United States economy $249 billion</a>. 75% of that cost was directly related to binge drinking. Nearly 88,000 people die from alcohol related causes annually. In 2014, alcohol related driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths or 31% of traffic fatalities.</p>
