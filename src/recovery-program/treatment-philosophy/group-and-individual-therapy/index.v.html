		<h3>The holistic approach expalined</h3>
		<p>On almost every addiction-treatment-program’s website you’ll find the catch-all phrase, “We offer a holistic approach to addiction treatment.” This catch-all phrase is used broadly to describe treatment of the whole individual and not just the addiction. The addiction is, therefore, a manifestation of underlying issues that need to be addressed to either reduce or remove entirely the abuse of drugs and alcohol.</p>
		<p>When it comes to young adults, especially the young adults we serve, you can remove the drugs and alcohol via a medical detox, but once medically stable we have to discover the root causes for the use in the first place. Root causes may include past trauma such as emotional or physical abuse, it may include underlying mental-health issues such as bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, or anxiety disorders; it may even be fundamentally related to adolescent behaviors and mentalities. Clinically speaking, then, if we do not promote the psychological, emotional, physical, spiritual, and cognitive healing, then, we have done nothing to undo the root causes of the substance use disorder and the chances for relapse are almost guaranteed.</p>
		<p>For young adults, particularly, it is extremely difficult to undo all the root causes for a variety of reasons. For example, in the case of trauma, there is a great deal of shame and guilt that may be associated with past traumatic experiences. To undo the reoccurring emotions surrounding the trauma is nearly impossible if the shame and guilt are not dealt with as well.</p>
		<p>At Peaks Recovery Centers we understand that both the addiction and underlying causes for the addiction manifest themselves differently for men and women. This is why we value a gender-specific, evidence-based treatment approach which have been empirically shown to be effective in the treatment of addiction and dual diagnosis. In fact, we are among a very small handful of treatment programs here in the state of Colorado that offer gender-specific treatment.</p>

		</ul>

		<br>
		<p>National relapse rates for any individual leaving a 30-day treatment setting is around 77%.</p>
		<p>The reason for this is because the process for shutting off our cravings for drugs and alcohol, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate ongoing mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing drugs and alcohol, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Triple Peaks Recovery and Serenity Peaks Recovery Centers we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from our unhealthy past.</p>
		<p>Extended Care, for the above reasons, matters. A sober home is, for example, a place to live among sober people. It does not, however, address any of the underlying issues and if those issues are not dealt with in an extended setting then the chances of relapse will be the same. For anyone pursuing treatment we invite you to take your recovery journey seriously, with us here in Colorado Springs, Colorado. We put recovery first every single day in our programs and we invite you to challenge yourself and extend your recovery investment here at Serenity Peaks and Triple Peaks.</p>
