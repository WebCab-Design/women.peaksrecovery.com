						<h4>Justin Lincoln PsyD</h4>
						<p><strong>Primary Therapist</strong></p>
						<p>As a person, I find it important to be “present” for life, whether spending time with my family, hanging out with my dog, reading, biking, writing, hiking, cooking, whatever. As a psychologist, I also strive to understand people in the context of the many stories of their lives. So-called “alternative” approaches to treatment are part of this sensibility, and not just for substance misuse difficulties. Yoga therapy, equine-facilitated psychotherapy, and other experiential ways to look at therapy can cultivate transformations that programs limited to traditional talk therapy simply can’t. I’ve worked with people struggling with substances in many different settings, and definitely appreciate that changes really can’t occur without some kind of connection being forged and honored.</p>

						<p><strong>Primary Therapist</strong></p>
						<p>I see life as a joyful noise even in the mist of hard times. I heard that joyful noise 21 years ago when my struggle with alcohol/drugs ended. I have lived the struggle within active addiction and the struggle to get out of addiction. I contribute my sobriety to developing a life of spirituality, healthy interaction with my family, and working a 12 step program of recovery. I love integrating humor within the therapeutic setting to foster hope and change. I strongly believe that change in thought patterns leads to changes in perceptions, which changes behavior. I have been working in the field of addiction for the past 20 years and has dedicated my life to helping others. I am currently a state certified therapist with a Counsling Addiction Level III licensure and will be completing my BS in Psychology in the near future.</p>

						<p>Kevin grew up in Greely, Colorado and enjoys everything the state has to offer.  He is an expert fly fisher and experienced outdoorsmen.  Kevin also enjoys spending time with his three children and enjoying the benefits of living clean and sober.  As former healthcare provider he has always enjoyed giving back to the community, and has a skill set that is uniquely suited to working in the recovery community.  Kevin fought a personal battle with addiction that lasted a number of years, and eventually surrendered to a program in Estes Park.  It was there that he found a passion for helping others deal with the disease of addiction.  Kevin started out at Triple Peaks as a residential House Manager, and threw himself into helping young men on their own path to recovery.  His dedication to the program, as well as his attention to detail were quickly recognized and he was promoted to the position of Treatment Coordinator within a year.  Kevin has been an invaluable asset to the Triple Peaks/Serenity Peaks organization and continues to facilitate the relationship between clients, parents, staff, courts, and healthcare providers.</p>

						<h4>Brandon Burns BA</h4>
						<p><strong>Director of Operations</strong></p>
						<p>Brandon is a graduate of the University of Washington who now possesses an all powerful Philosophy degree. After receiving his degree he was given the fortunate opportunity to work for his younger brother aka the Executive Director. Had you told Brandon that he'd be working for his younger brother over a decade ago, he would have likely laughed the notion away. Through the family lens of watching addiciton unfold in front of him, Brandon has witnessed the power of recovery not only through his brother, but everyday within the offices of Peaks Recovery Centers.</p>
						<p>Brandon is fascinated with the field of addiction and mental health treatment. It's a field so sure of itself, but at the same time, so unsure of itself, which leaves plenty of room for discovery and grow around-xsth. As the Director of Operations his goal is to ensure that our program never flat-lines and is always at the forefront of the substance abuse treatment discussion.</p>
