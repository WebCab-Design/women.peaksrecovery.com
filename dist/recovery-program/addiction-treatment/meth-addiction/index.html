			<!-- <h3>45% of Young Adults Report "Meth is Accessible"</h3>
			<hr> -->

			<h3>Why Peaks Recovery Centers after inpatient rehab?</h3>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year after treatment.</a></p>
			<p>At Peaks Recovery Centers we recognize that the process for shutting off methamphetamine cravings, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing methamphetamines, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from methamphetamine addiction.</p>
			<p>The longer young adults participate in treatment programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Centers we believe it paramount to the long-term success of young adults and their recovery that they continue with extended care treatment. Our six-month program allows each individual to incrementally move forward in their recovery rather than being exposed to an array of immeidiate challenges that often times can be defeating in early recovery. Our programs are favorably structured for young adults and specifically designed to promote long-term recovery in an accountable, communal setting.</p>

			<h3>Methamphetamine Addiction and Young Adults</h3>
			<p>Though methampethatimne is highly addictive, it is generally one of the least used substances among young adults. About 3% of all young adults 18-25 will try meth within their lifetime. 1% of young adults used meth within the last year and only 1/5th of 1% have used within the last month during the time of study.</p>
			<p>Even if methamphetamine is not widely used, it is still widely available. In a 2008 study 45% of young adults reported the drug being accessible and 30% reported that the drug had been directly offered to them. 20% of teenagers believe there is no risk in at least trying the drug. And though meth use is on the decline for young adults in general, it is still important to note that some young adults will start using meth and given its highly addictive potential, treatment may be necessary to undo the dependency.</p>

			<h3>Effects of Methamphetamine</h3>
			<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dbc2wlvk8/image/upload/c_fill,fl_any_format.lossy,w_300/v1480719761/peaks/peaks-centers/Methamphetamine-Molecule.jpg" align="left" alt="Methamphetamine Addiction Molecule">
			<p>Methamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system. It is a derivative of the drug amphetamine. Like amphetamine, methamphetamine causes increased activity and talkativeness, decreased appetite, and a pleasurable sense of well-being or euphoria. Methamphetamine differs in that it is a far more potent stimulant in that larger amounts of it make it to the brain than your typical amphetamine used for ADHD or narcolepsy. Meth also lasts for far longer periods leading to more harmful effects on the central nervous system.</p>
			<p>There are seven phases associated with using methamphetamine. The first is known as the rush. Methamphetamine rush includes increased heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. The rush can continue for up to thirty minutes.</p>
			<p>The second stage is the actual high or sometimes referred to as the shoulder. During this stage the abuser often feels aggressively smarter and may be overly argumentative, quick to interrupt others and finish their sentences. This delusional effect can result in the user becoming intently focused on insignificant items such as excessively cleaning windows. The high, depending on dosage and user, can last anywhere from four to sixteen hours.</p>
			<p>The third stage is known as the binge and refers to the user desiring both a continued rush and high. The binge can last anywhere from three to fifteen days. With every inhalation or injection the user experiences another rush and high, but ultimately after continued use the rush and high effects become diminished until there is no rush or high.</p>
			<p>The fourth stage is known as tweaking and is the most dangerous stage for the user. At this stage he or she are no longer able to relieve the horrible feelings of emptiness and craving associated with the inability to get high again. Their sense of identity becomes diminished followed by intense itching and the feeling of having bugs crawling underneath the skin. The person is also unable to sleep and may be awake for several days at a time. The user is in a complete psychotic state. Hallucinations escalate and further disconnects him or her from reality resulting in hostility toward self and others. The potential for self-mutilation is high.</p>
			<p>The fifth stage is known as the crash. In this stage the body literally shuts down resulting in long periods of sleep for the person. Many individuals appear lifeless during this stage.</p>
			<p>After the crash, the abuser returns in a deteriorated state, starved, dehydrated, and utterly exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. This phase can last between two and fourteen days.</p>
			<p>Finally, there is withdrawal. The solution to the prior phase is to take more meth. Thirty to ninety days can pass after the last drug use before the abuser realizes that he or she is in withdrawal. The effects can leave a person uncrecognizable. 93% of methamphetamine users will relapse after treatment.</p>
