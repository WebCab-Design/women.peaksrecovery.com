		<!-- <h3>Live Life in Recovery</h3> -->

		<h3>How does job search work?</h3>
		<p>Depending on each client’s progress within the program, when he or she is ready to step-down from two group therapy sessions per day to only having one group therapy session per day, they must hold a job or be actively participating in school course work.</p>
		<p>After their morning groups, every client in the IOP setting has the opportunity to work Monday-Friday 11AM-5PM, including anytime on Saturday. Along the way both Triple Peaks and Serenity Peaks staff members help with resume building, filling out applications, and provide transportation to and from work. Every client will hold a job during their time within our program and we have never failed to see someone find a job. When they receive their first paycheck they will start to budget their own weekly allowance for food and toiletries. We also require that each client take on their own cell phone payment after receiving their first paycheck as well. All other money earned from their job is saved and given to them in full upon completion of the program. When properly budgeted, individuals can save anywhere from &#36;1,000 to &#36;3,000 within the time period of our program giving them a great start in the next part of their recovery journey.</p>

		<h3>Why is this important to our client’s recovery journey?</h3>
		<p>At Peaks Recovery Centers the end treatment goal for all our clients is for them to be accountable, independent adults who are able to work and maintain a job, pay bills, and live a life of recovery. Working alone can present major challenges for an individual in early recovery e.g. dealing with the defeating thoughts often associated with job searches, working on emotional regulation under stressful situations, dealing with customers effectively, and potentially working around individuals who are themselves using drugs and alcohol.</p>
		<p>Though the drugs and alcohol are removed, young adults still lack valuable coping mechanisms for how to deal with life stressors, including both the search for a job and the responsibility of holding a job. The end goal for having the life skills component of our recovery program is to put each client in front of as many real world challenges as possible. If there is a lack of coping mechanisms available to any individual within our program, both their peers and our staff are then given the opportunity to witness those struggles and help support those individuals as they walk through those challenging moments.</p>
		<p>Finding a balance between the clinical setting and implementation of true life skills, we believe, gives each young adult a necessary foundation for early recovery. A foundation which they can stand on firmly at the end of our six-month program. Life happens at Serenity Peaks Recovery and Triple Peaks Recovery Centers, welcome to real recovery.</p>

						<p>Everyday millions of individuals and their families are affected by substance use disorder. Studies show that the longer young adults participate in treatment programs and stay active in their recovery, the more likely it is that they will achieve long-term sobriety and stability. We believe it paramount to the long-term success of young adults and their recovery that they continue with extended care treatment. Our client’s personal growth and recovery from alcohol and substance abuse is our highest priority. It’s why we do what we do. At Triple Peaks and Serenity Peaks we value how special your loved one is and we are committed to their long-term recovery and personal growth.</p>
