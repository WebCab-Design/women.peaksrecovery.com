		<h3>The holistic approach expalined</h3>
		<p>On almost every addiction-treatment-program’s website you’ll find the catch-all phrase, “We offer a holistic approach to addiction treatment.” This catch-all phrase is used broadly to describe treatment of the whole individual and not just the addiction. The addiction is, therefore, a manifestation of underlying issues that need to be addressed to either reduce or remove entirely the abuse of drugs and alcohol.</p>
		<p>When it comes to young adults, especially the young adults we serve, you can remove the drugs and alcohol via a medical detox, but once medically stable we have to discover the root causes for the use in the first place. Root causes may include past trauma such as emotional or physical abuse, it may include underlying mental-health issues such as bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, or anxiety disorders; it may even be fundamentally related to adolescent behaviors and mentalities. Clinically speaking, then, if we do not promote the psychological, emotional, physical, spiritual, and cognitive healing, then, we have done nothing to undo the root causes of the substance use disorder and the chances for relapse are almost guaranteed.</p>
		<p>For young adults, particularly, it is extremely difficult to undo all the root causes for a variety of reasons. For example, in the case of trauma, there is a great deal of shame and guilt that may be associated with past traumatic experiences. To undo the reoccurring emotions surrounding the trauma is nearly impossible if the shame and guilt are not dealt with as well.</p>
		<p>At Peaks Recovery Centers we understand that both the addiction and underlying causes for the addiction manifest themselves differently for men and women. This is why we value a gender-specific, evidence-based treatment approach which have been empirically shown to be effective in the treatment of addiction and dual diagnosis. In fact, we are among a very small handful of treatment programs here in the state of Colorado that offer gender-specific treatment.</p>

		<br>
		<p><strong>Evidence-based Approach</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Depending on where each client is at in their level of care we offer intensive individual and group therapy from 15 to 30 hours per week, which includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</li>
					<li>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy</li>
					<li>EMDR Trauma Therapy</li>
					<li>Vocational/ Art Therapy</li>
					<li>Relapse Prevention</li>
					<li>Process Groups</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Daily 12 Step Meetings for connecting with other, like-minded individuals.</li>
			<li>Gym Membership with guided yoga, cross-fit, and other workouts.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Weekly</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Equine Therapy</li>
					<li>Auricular Acupuncture – for clients in first 30 days</li>
					<li>Volunteer/ Service Work</li>
					<li>Registered Dietitian</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Weekly contact with family members to help heal the family system</li>
			<li>Monthly family sessions</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<p><strong>Environment of Care</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nationally Accredited by the Joint Commission for safety in our environment of care</li>
			<li>Compassionate, professional staff</li>
			<li>Full transportation for any and all activities including work</li>
			<li>Fully structured homes, staffed 24/7</li>
			<li>Daily chores and responsibilities for each client</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<p>National relapse rates for any individual leaving a 30-day treatment setting is around 77%.</p>
		<p>The reason for this is because the process for shutting off our cravings for drugs and alcohol, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate ongoing mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing drugs and alcohol, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Triple Peaks Recovery and Serenity Peaks Recovery Centers we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from our unhealthy past.</p>
		<p>Extended Care, for the above reasons, matters. A sober home is, for example, a place to live among sober people. It does not, however, address any of the underlying issues and if those issues are not dealt with in an extended setting then the chances of relapse will be the same. For anyone pursuing treatment we invite you to take your recovery journey seriously, with us here in Colorado Springs, Colorado. We put recovery first every single day in our programs and we invite you to challenge yourself and extend your recovery investment here at Serenity Peaks and Triple Peaks.</p>

						<p>Everyday millions of individuals and their families are affected by substance use disorder. Studies show that the longer young adults participate in treatment programs and stay active in their recovery, the more likely it is that they will achieve long-term sobriety and stability. We believe it paramount to the long-term success of young adults and their recovery that they continue with extended care treatment. Our client’s personal growth and recovery from alcohol and substance abuse is our highest priority. It’s why we do what we do. At Triple Peaks and Serenity Peaks we value how special your loved one is and we are committed to their long-term recovery and personal growth.</p>
